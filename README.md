# ProjectOsiris!

## Purpose
The goal of the project is to simplify the steps taken when a new system is set up, whether it is windows or linux based. This is handled through a number of batch/shell scripts for varying systems.

Input is welcome, and might be considered depending on applicable use cases.

## Installables
### Windows
#### Batch Scripts
These scripts modify some system environment related settings.

These changes include:
  * Adding Plink to the Environment Path, so ssh-agent is available to command line

#### Registry Edits
Changes to the registry can be applied by running the add/remove scripts.

These changes include:
  * Adding Shift+Right Click for Admin and User command prompts
  * Using UTC for Windows Time

### Linux
